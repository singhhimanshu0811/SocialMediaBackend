# Imp

1. auto config of tomcat server by spring boot
2. dispatcher servelet- routes incoming requests to appropriate controllers
3. @restcontroller tells that this is controller class, which creates a bean for this class which is mapped back to controller. spring boot does all of it for us
4. default error mapping-error if you go to some other endpoint

used for configuring the pre-configured setup given to us by springboot
you can refer these at website https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/appendix/application-properties/index.html#application-properties.server.server.port
